            The term lean testing for web applications was established in 2013 by Nils Langner, one of our founders. It was the result of
            the observation that there are some simple tests or checks for websites that always fail when a website or a feature is broken.

        <p>
            At that time it was normal that test coverage was very high. Complex functional tests with selenium where on the agenda. Behavior
            Driven Development was on its high point. It was the time of great architecture and clean code. The only problem with the
            clean approach was the time it took implement and test an application.

        </p>
        <p>
            When using the lean testing approach and finding the right simple checks there is a good chance to create a good enough test coverage
            within a fraction of the time and costs.

            From a project management point of view Eric Ries fought that development with his Lean Startup approach. It helped focussing
            on a minimal viable product and shipping your application early. But
