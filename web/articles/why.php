                    On the one hand customers want quality but on the other customers don't want to pay for it. With Leankoala we
                    provide a strategy and the suitable test suite that focuses on efficient and affordable quality assurance.

                <h3>Great for publishing companies</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea behind lean testing and Leankoala originated from eight years testing websites from two of the biggest publishing
                    companies in europe. We know how to handle editorial content that meets technology.

                <h3>Easy for website operators</h3>
                <p>
                    When developing Leankoala one thing we always had in mind was that it must be easy to solve standard problems and possible to
                    solve the hard ones. For all website operators we kept the entry threshold low.

                <h3>Efficiency for quality managers</h3>
                <p>
                    Hitting your website with heavy tools can be very expensive. Having a risk based lean approach reduces cost and helps
                    testing your websites much faster with less effort.

            <h2>Perfect for agencies</h2>

        <p>
            The agency business can be very tough. Customers want their web projects to be developed in no time, with low costs and high
            quality. That to achieve is almost impossible. In many cases one of the three goals has to be dropped and mostly it's quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our observations revealed dropping quality does not equal that it is the least important goal. In our opinion it is often a wrong
            understanding of what quality means. Most projects are from an objective point of view <span style="">only</span> standard. You connect standard features
            and components to create a new system. Additionally there are only a few use cases in that system that have real business values.
        </p>
        <p>
            For testing those <strong>standard features</strong> Leankoala provides <strong>standard checks</strong>. Often that is all that
            is needed. In addition we offer a new and different testing concept we already verified on many conferences, press article and the
            german book
            "<a href="https://www.amazon.de/Erfolgreiche-Softwareprojekte-Web-Gedanken-Webentwicklung/dp/3868020888" target="_blank">Erfolgreiche
                Softwareprojekt im Web</a>". One of our goals is to push the lean testing movement so you don't have to sell it to your client.
